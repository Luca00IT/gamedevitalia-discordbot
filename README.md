# Warden, the Discord bot.
This is the code written for the "Warden" bot on my Discord server called "Game Dev Italia." 
The bot was created to answer some general questions from users and use some basic commands with the prefix !
This template is therefore usable by anyone who wants to emulate the behavior of the bot I created.
With each function I add in my bot I will update the code here so that it can always be Open Source and up to date.

You can then use this code to create your bot and start immediately with simple commands.
